This code uses the JOptionPane class to display dialog boxes for input and output. It generates a random number between the minNumber and maxNumber range. The user has a limited number of attempts defined by maxAttempts.

The score is calculated based on the remaining attempts, and the user is awarded 10 points per remaining attempt. The game notifies the user if their guess is too high or too low and ends when the user guesses the correct number or runs out of attempts.
